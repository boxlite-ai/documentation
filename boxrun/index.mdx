BoxRun wraps the BoxLite micro-VM runtime into a batteries-included platform: a REST API server, CLI, web dashboard, and SDKs for Python and Rust — all in a single binary.

<Tip>
  Want to embed sandboxing as a library instead? See the [BoxLite SDK quickstarts](/getting-started/index).
</Tip>

## How it works

The `boxrun serve` process runs an HTTP/Unix socket server (axum + tokio) that manages the full lifecycle of micro-VMs via BoxLite. Clients — the CLI, Python SDK, or a browser — talk to this server. State is persisted in a single SQLite database; real-time output is streamed via SSE.

BoxRun is built on [BoxLite](/architecture/index), which provides the underlying micro-VM runtime. BoxRun adds orchestration, persistence, and a multi-client server layer on top.

## Box lifecycle

```text
creating --> running <--> stopped
                |              |
                +--> error     +--> (rm)
                       |
                       +--> (rm)
```

- **creating** — box is being provisioned by BoxLite
- **running** — box is up and accepting commands
- **stopped** — box is paused, disk state preserved
- **error** — box creation or runtime failure

Disk state persists across stop/start cycles. Only `rm` (remove) destroys data.

## Web dashboard

A built-in web UI is available at `http://localhost:9090/ui` when the server is running. You can view all boxes, start/stop/delete them, and see execution history.
