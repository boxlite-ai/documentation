You've installed BoxLite and run "Hello from BoxLite!" — now what? These tutorials walk you through the most common tasks, with working code you can copy and adapt.

## Which box type should I use?

| I want to... | Use | Tutorial |
|---|---|---|
| Run Claude Code in a sandbox | **SimpleBox** | [Claude Code](/tutorials/ai-coding-tools) |
| Run a shell command in isolation | **SimpleBox** | [Quick Start](/getting-started/quickstart-python) |
| Execute AI-generated Python code | **CodeBox** | [Execute AI-generated code](/tutorials/code-execution) |
| Upload and download files | **SimpleBox** or **CodeBox** | [Upload & download files](/tutorials/file-transfer) |
| Connect an LLM to a sandbox | **CodeBox** | [Connect to an LLM](/tutorials/llm-integration) |
| Automate a browser | **BrowserBox** | [Automate a browser](/tutorials/browser-automation) |
| Control a full desktop | **ComputerBox** | [SDK Reference](/reference/python/box-types#computerbox) |
| Run an interactive shell session | **InteractiveBox** | [SDK Reference](/reference/python/box-types#interactivebox) |

<Tip>
  Not sure? Start with **CodeBox** — it handles the most common AI agent use case (running untrusted code) and auto-installs packages for you.
