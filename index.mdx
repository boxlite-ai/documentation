BoxLite lets you spin up lightweight Linux VMs and run OCI containers inside them. Unlike ephemeral sandboxes that destroy state after each execution, BoxLite Boxes are **stateful workspaces** — install packages, create files, build up environment state, then come back later and pick up where you left off. Every sandbox is a real microVM with its own kernel, providing hardware-level isolation that containers can't match.

Runs on macOS (Apple Silicon), Linux (KVM), and Windows (WSL2).

## Why BoxLite?

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Stateful" icon="database">
    Boxes retain packages, files, and environment across stop/restart. No rebuilding on every interaction.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local-first" icon="cube">
    Runs entirely on your machine — no cloud account needed. A library, not a service. Scale out when ready.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hardware isolation" icon="shield-halved">
    Each sandbox is a real microVM with its own Linux kernel. Full hardware isolation via KVM or Apple Hypervisor.framework.

## Quick start

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # pip install boxlite
    import asyncio
    import boxlite

    async def main():
        async with boxlite.SimpleBox(image="alpine:latest") as box:
            result = await box.exec("echo", "Hello from BoxLite!")
            print(result.stdout)

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    // npm install @boxlite-ai/boxlite
    import { SimpleBox } from '@boxlite-ai/boxlite';

    const box = new SimpleBox({ image: 'alpine:latest' });
    try {
      const result = await box.exec('echo', 'Hello from BoxLite!');
      console.log(result.stdout);
    } finally {
      await box.stop();
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

## BoxRun — sandbox management

**BoxRun** is the management layer for BoxLite sandboxes. Create, list, stop, and delete boxes through a CLI, REST API, Python SDK, or web dashboard — all in a single binary.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://boxlite.ai/boxrun/install | sh
boxrun shell ubuntu
```

BoxLite creates and runs micro-VMs. BoxRun manages them — tracking state, persisting data, and exposing operations over HTTP and CLI.
