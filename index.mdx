Welcome to the BoxLite documentation. BoxLite is a lightweight, embeddable virtual machine runtime that provides hardware-level isolation without requiring a daemon or root privileges. Embed it directly in your application for secure, sandboxed code execution.

<Note>
  BoxLite v0.4.4 is stable and production-ready. It runs on **macOS** (Apple Silicon via Hypervisor.framework) and **Linux** (via KVM), with Windows support through WSL2.
