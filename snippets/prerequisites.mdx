## Prerequisites

Before getting started with BoxLite, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon or Intel), Linux (kernel 5.10+), or Windows 11 with WSL2
- **Container Runtime**: OCI-compatible runtime (included with BoxLite)
- **Disk Space**: At least 2 GB free for container images
- **Memory**: Minimum 4 GB RAM recommended

<Note>
  BoxLite uses native OS sandboxing (Apple Sandbox on macOS, namespaces on Linux) for lightweight isolation. No Docker or VM installation is required.
